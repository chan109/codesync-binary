1.On one client side input the following assume its id is 456:
    {"event" : "list", "payload" : [123]}
        --> a list of users which the binary tries to connect

  wants to send the offer to user with id 123


The console will return a list of sdp offer info {"type": "offer", "sdp": .....}

2.Go to the other client ( assume its id is 123) console and paste the data with following format:

    {"event": "offer", "payload": {"from":456,"data": {"type": "offer"........(the offer is given from the previous step)}

  Remark: "from": <id>, where id the client who creates the offer


  Then the sdp for the answer will be prompted on the console, and copy it

3.2.Go to the other client ( assume its id is 456) console and paste the data with following format:

    {"event":"answer","payload":{"from":123,"data": {"type" : "answer" ........(the answer is given from the previous step)



At that point the p2p connection should finish
At console, should see success and DATA : Ping

Way to deliever the data:

{"event" : "broadcast", "payload" : "hello world"}

--> It send hello world to whoever has established the p2p connection

{"event" : "message", "payload" : { "to": "123", "data": "Mamaibi"}}
-->Specify which user I want to send the message
